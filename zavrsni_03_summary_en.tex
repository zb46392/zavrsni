\subsection*{Poker game implementation and agent creation using machine learning}

Poker is a popular card game, that has many variations in game rules. This paper describes the implementation of Limit Texas Hold'em tournament in the programming language Python version 3.7.3. All players receive a certain amount of chips and the main goal of this game is to collect all of the opponents chips. Through different phases in the game, all players place a bet, or quit from the current round. In the final phase the player with the strongest hand collects the wagered chips. In general Texas Hold'em is a variation of poker where all players receive two cards, five cards are getting turned over on the table and all players build their final hand with five arbitrarily cards from their hand or table. 'Limit' refers to the beforehand defined value of bets and raises. After the third re-raise, raising gets capped. 'Tournament' means that the game is played until one player has collected all the chips. The goal of this work is implementing an intelligent agent that through reinforcement learning is able to learn playing the game. Frameworks used for building the agent are PyTorch 1.3.1 for assembling and manipulation of neural networks and Tensorboard 2.3.0 for tracking progress and value changes inside the network.
